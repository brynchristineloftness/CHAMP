# ChAMP Background

## What is ChAMP?
*Background:* Internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression, in pre-school aged children are common and often go undiagnosed into adulthood. Delayed intervention can increase risk for interpersonal impairments, substance abuse, and increased risk for suicide, thus, early identification is crucial. However, early subjective assessment of anxiety and depression present challenges as self-reports are not reliable in children younger than 8 years, and parental-reports often exhibit bias and poor sensitivity. Previously, we have presented an objective assessment demonstrating good accuracy (75%-81%) in identifying early childhood anxiety and depression which uses physiology (motion and audio) measured via wearable sensors during brief mood induction tasks. However, these methods required specialized equipment and expertise in data and sensor engineering to administer and analyze. 

*Method:* To improve ecological validity, we have developed the ChAMP System, which includes an Android mobile application for collecting movement and audio data during mood induction tasks, a waist belt for attaching the phone to participants, and an open-source data analysis platform for extracting digital biomarkers and discovering digital phenotypes. As proof of principle, we  present data collected using the ChAMP System from 50 children ages 5-8, with and without anxiety or depressive disorders.  

*Results:* Results indicate that several movement and audio-derived features significantly differ between diagnostic status groups and correlate with symptom severity. We provide a route for other researchers to request usage of the ChAMP System, lowering the barrier to entry for those interested in exploring digital phenotyping of childhood mental health but who may not have the background in signal processing or data science.  

*Conclusions:* We aim to continue to build this scalable platform to aid in early identification of anxiety and depressive disorders in young children by crowd-sourcing validation efforts and making it accessible to researchers across domains and locations.
