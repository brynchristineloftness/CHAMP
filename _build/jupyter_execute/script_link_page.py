# 
# #### Before beginning, you must download the real-world example files from our ChAMP data or collect your own data using the ChAMP mobile application. 
# 
# To download the open access dataset already collected by our team, go [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CDAYxIMWCOtvndpSXO0XaQLqx-Gw0nl7?usp=sharing). Save this data in this folder to the home directory of your Google Drive in a folder called "*champ_data*" to use directly with the ChAMP interactive script. Ensure each action log file is in the format of *S###.actionLog.projectmHealth.csv* and each data log file is in the format of *S###.dataLog.projectmHealth.csv*, where S### represents the subject ID.
# 
# To request download access for the ChAMP mobile application to collect your own dataset, please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/PEfwybkiAM) or scan this QR code.

# To access the script with step-by-step instructions, go [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g6yjky4avTAsZMPUO4AFukOi75jci2DO) or click the rocket ship icon in the upper right corner of this page and select from the drop-down to open in Google Colab. Once you are on the script page, under the top options bar click "Copy to Drive". Once you've made the folder with data (champ_data) in the home directory of your drive, on the top click "Runtime" -> "Run All". You will be prompted to connect your google drive to the script. Once the program has completed running (may take a minute or two depending on the number of files), one CSV will be downloaded onto your computer with features extracted for each subject.
